        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying theater arts with a minor in creative writing. I work for the Mack Library at the circulation desk. I enjoy reading and writing books and hope to publish some one day. English and Grammar has always been one of my favorite subjects, and I am frequently asked to read over other people's essays for classes. The library is a nice place to relax and research for projects or just for enjoyment. </p>
         <p>
            I volunteered to shelve at my local bookstore in Corning, New York. I am actively involved in my home church with VBS, Sunday school, and I hope to find a local church here to participate in. I really like working with children, which is what I hope my theater major will help me expand on. I want to work as an elementary/highschool play director and/or volunteer directing plays at church. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also really love dill pickles and have chugged an entire jar of the pickles and juice in one sitting. I grew up on a farm and once taught my entire algebra class the fertilization process because one girl did not want to eat "unborn chicks." I have a fiance; we had been dating for a year, and we are planning to get married next summer.
